## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Local font integration (`@font-face`)
- Responsive design principles

### What I learned

This section is a great place to reflect on what you've learned. For example:

- How to effectively use `@font-face` for custom local fonts.
- Techniques for creating card layouts with Flexbox.
- Implementing hover states for interactive elements.
- Best practices for structuring HTML for accessibility and maintainability.

```css
/* Example of a CSS snippet I'm proud of or found challenging */
.card:hover h1 {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
```

### Continued development

- Exploring more advanced CSS layout techniques (e.g., CSS Grid).
- Deepening my understanding of JavaScript for interactive components.
- Improving my workflow for responsive design.

### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs - This is an invaluable resource for any web developer, providing detailed information on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
